<h1>Current Projects</h1>

<p> Currently I am working on my first mobile game which I plan to release for iOS and Android in July 2015. It is almost finished now, as I am just making it look pretty by replacing rectangles with images and adding in animations. I am not 100% on the name BowMaster but for now thats what I have named it. Check out the images below to get an idea of what is looks like currently. There are two castle on either side of you screen, one is yours and the other is the enemies. The objective is to protect your castle by staying alive and eliminating the enemy. The game is 100% functional and works perfectly, I have tested it on my phone too and had lots of fun.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to release it on the app stores to share it with the world, stay tuned.</p>

<h1>GFX Projects</h1>

<p> Before learning to program I learned Adobe Photoshop. I learned out of personal interest by following random tutorials on the internet on how to create awesome effects. After a couple years of playing around in Photoshop I can proudly say that I have mastered the program, after taking a couple courses and teaching students and even the teacher of the course many new things I am very confident with my abilities to create any desired effect.</p>

<h1>Java Projects</h1>

<p> I have spent the majority of my time programming in Java, this is also the first language I learned. I started learning Java from the Computer Science course I took in high school but I quickly went ahead of my class and continued to learn it on all my free time, which in the end resulted in my final project being a full 2D platformer game: Purgatory Elusion. I also finished two other games in java but didn't get them working on a web browser, but you can check them out as well as a game I made in C++ here.

A game called Poly Racer was grade 12 final project and is my greatest accomplishment to date. Last time was a 2D game for my final project so this time I made a huge step up: a 3D game. Everything was coded from scratch even the 3D engine. Basically you are controlling a ship and must dodge incoming cubes, there are power ups to enhance your ship, levels and even high scores. This game is programmed entirely in java and has been deployed as an applet and a full screen aplication, I highly encourage you to check it out here.

Recently I also attended Hack Western where I made a game in 36 hours that got us into the top 6 out of over 150 teams. It is based around helping scientists analyze gene microarrays to cure cancer. We took a new direction on this by making it a fun to play game where the user creates their own path through the data to collect as many orbs as possible. This is also the first game where I have successfully incorporated fully function AI as there are little blobs that you must avoid to collect as many orbs as possible. It is made in java and deployed perfectly over the web, playable by everyone at HackingCancer.me. </p>


<h1>C++ Projects</h1>

<p> In the summer of 2012 I dedicated myself to learning C++. To do this I read Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days. Since I had already mastered Java, C++ was very easy to pick up as they are almost identical. Learning the basics of the language was easy but to actually make a game with it, I would have to use a separate library to implement graphics, this I did next summer.

In the summer of 2013 I spent 3 weeks working on creating my first game in C++ with the SDL library. The game is called Kassaria, I am unable to embed it on a webpage as it is an exe file so I have added it to a video of the other games I have created, you can check this out here. I was able to complete all the basics of the game engine. This game is a 2D RPG where you traverse a world made of blocks. For this game I focused on creating the engine that would be able to break and place blocks, move around with boundaries and collisions, be able to save and load the world from a text file and lighting. These were the most challenging part and took an entire three weeks to complete but now with all the basics complete I can easily expand the game further. </p>

<h1>Flash Projects</h1>

<p>In high school I took a course called Communications Technology in which we had a unit on flash. Originally for this assignment we just had to create a simple flash animation but I thought this was too easy and took this assignment to the next level by making a game. You can see this game below or the full screen version and play it using the arrow keys to dodge the oncoming birds. I had never considered making a game with flash before but in the end it was definitely worth it, as flash has made this process extremely easy. In the future I plan to learn more about the Flash programming language: Actionscript 3. The language was made keeping game making in mind which I really enjoy doing. </p>
