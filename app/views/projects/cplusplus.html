<h1>C++ Projects</h1>

<p> In the summer of 2012 I dedicated myself to learning C++. To do this I read Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days. Since I had already mastered Java, C++ was very easy to pick up as they are almost identical. Learning the basics of the language was easy but to actually make a game with it, I would have to use a separate library to implement graphics, this I did next summer.

In the summer of 2013 I spent 3 weeks working on creating my first game in C++ with the SDL library. The game is called Kassaria, I am unable to embed it on a webpage as it is an exe file so I have added it to a video of the other games I have created, you can check this out here. I was able to complete all the basics of the game engine. This game is a 2D RPG where you traverse a world made of blocks. For this game I focused on creating the engine that would be able to break and place blocks, move around with boundaries and collisions, be able to save and load the world from a text file and lighting. These were the most challenging part and took an entire three weeks to complete but now with all the basics complete I can easily expand the game further. </p>
